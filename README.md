üöÄ Projects
## Week 1 Project: Customer Sign-up & Support Ticket Analysis

Description: Focused on analyzing customer sign-up patterns and their interaction with support services. This involved cleaning and summarizing customer demographic data and an optional integration with support ticket data to understand customer behavior and potential pain points.

Focus Areas:

Data Preparation: Loading and cleaning a single customer sign-up dataset (customer_signups.csv), handling missing values (e.g., signup_date, age, email), standardizing categorical data (plan_selected, gender, region), and removing duplicates.

Data Analysis: Summarizing sign-ups by week, source, region, and plan selected. Analyzing marketing opt-in rates by gender and age distribution.

Optional Integration: Merged with support_tickets.csv to calculate the likelihood of customers contacting support by their selected plan.

Key Insights: Identified trends in customer acquisition channels, regional distribution of users, and potential correlations between plan selection and support engagement.

Technologies Used: Python (Pandas), Google Colab.

## Week 2 Project: Green Cart Ltd. Sales & Customer Behaviour Analysis

Description: Analyzed sales and customer data for Green Cart Ltd., a UK-based eco-friendly e-commerce company, to provide insights for their Q2 performance review.

**Focus Areas:**

Data Preparation: Loading, comprehensive cleaning (handling inconsistent labels, missing data, duplicates, type conversions), and merging of three datasets (sales_data.csv, product_info.csv, customer_info.csv).

Feature Engineering: Creation of key metrics like revenue, order_week, price_band, email_domain, and is_late.

Data Analysis & Visualization: Summarizing key findings and generating various plots (line, bar charts) to identify trends in sales, customer behavior, and delivery performance.

Key Insights: Identified a significant revenue peak in Order Week 23, highlighted the impact of discounts, and noted a high rate of delivery delays.

Technologies Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Google Colab.

Relevant Files: ProjectWeek2.ipynb, sales_data.csv, product_info.csv, customer_info.csv√π
